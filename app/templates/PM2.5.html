<h2 style="font-family: georgia, garamond, serif; font-size: 26px; font-style: italic; text-align: center;">Particulate Matter (PM2.5)</h2>
<p style="font-family: georgia, garamond, serif; font-size: 16px;">Particulate matter refers to mixtures of microscopic solid and liquid particles suspended in air. There are two types of particulate matter that are most relevant to air pollution: PM10 and PM2.5. PM10 refers to particles that are between 2.5 and 10 microns; some examples of these include dust, pollen, and particles of mold. PM2.5 consists of fine particles that are 2.5 microns in diameter or less; fuel combustion, cigarette smoke, aerosols, and more can form them. Particulate matter is a health risk because it is small enough to be inhaled and deposits itself in airways of the human body. The smaller particles can even lodge themselves deep in the lungs or enter the bloodstream. Even short term exposure to PM10 has been associated with worsening respiratory diseases and can lead to emergency room visits. Long-term exposure (months to years) has been linked to premature death, especially in people with chronic conditions, and leads to reduced lung function in children [3]. WHO recommends a maximum exposure of 20 &mu;g/m3 for PM10 and a maximum exposure of 10 &mu;g/m3 for PM2.5 [31]. Measuring particulate matter in indoor air can lead to user implementable corrective actions. Users or researchers can view both event-specific and long-term PM levels, allowing them to assess the risks or benefits of specific lifestyle actions (i.e. being in an open vehicle in traffic) and their living environments at home (i.e. cooking practices and household chemical products).</p>
<p style="font-family: georgia, garamond, serif; font-size: 16px;">We can observe the user&rsquo;s response to particulate matter exposure using audio streams from a mobile phone or wearable device. The collected audio stream can be used to detect coughs [12], and allows us to monitor the changes in coughing, sneezing, wheezing and other audible symptoms in relation to changes in exposure to both PM2.5 and PM10 particles.</p>

<p style="font-family: georgia, garamond, serif; font-size: 18px;">Example (Time Series):</p>
<p style="font-family: georgia, garamond, serif; font-size: 14px;">Experiments measured particulate matter in 4 different conditions: daily residential life in the US, open traffic in India, daytime, and nighttime. The goal in the second condition was to see how the atmosome data, displayed in the figure below, correlated with the throat infection that a participant sitting in an open 3-wheeler during the India traffic stretch developed after the journey. Analysis revealed that the particulate matter they inhaled, which exceeded the healthy recommendation, played a causal role in the sudden bout of throat and respiratory discomfort.</p>

<p style="font-family: georgia, garamond, serif; font-size: 18px;"><br />Example (Conditions):</p>
<p style="font-family: georgia, garamond, serif; font-size: 14px;">The user&rsquo;s cumulative PM2.5 exposure data is plotted in the figure below. If a physician or user could access this kind of data regularly, they would gain insights on how their behavior and surroundings affect their bodies and take tangible steps towards staying healthy in traffic on vacation or other similar situations.&nbsp;</p>
