<h2 style="font-family: georgia, garamond, serif; font-size: 26px; font-style: italic; text-align: center;">&nbsp;Ozone</h2> <p style="font-family: georgia, garamond, serif; font-size: 16px;">While ozone in the stratosphere protects the Earth from the harmful rays of the sun, the ozone created at the ground level due to pollution is dangerous and can harm both humans and crops. Breathing ozone can trigger a variety of health problems, including chest pain, coughing, throat irritation, and airway inflammation. It can also worsen bronchitis, emphysema, and asthma, leading to the need for increased medical care [1]. In the United States in 2016, 90 percent of noncompliance to the national ambient air quality standards was due to ozone. Both short-term and long-term exposures to ozone, at concentrations below the current regulatory standards, are associated with increased mortality due to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases [2].</p> <p style="font-family: georgia, garamond, serif; font-size: 16px;">The guidelines for ozone exposure are the following: 0.05ppm is considered safe for up to 8 hours of exposure for someone doing heavy work outdoors. 0.08ppm is safe for up to 8 hours of exposure for someone doing moderate work outdoors. 0.1ppm is considered safe for up to 8 hours of exposure for someone doing light work outdoors. No more than 2 hours of exposure if safe for anyone for an ozone level of 0.2ppm or more [3].</p> <hr style="width: 70%;" /> <p style="font-family: georgia, garamond, serif; font-size: 18px;">Example (Timeseries):</p> <p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/cd9469_fd6488cc90da4cbfa431568a11b5b53f~mv2.jpg" alt="" width="585" height="184" /></p> <p style="font-family: georgia, garamond, serif; font-size: 12px; color: #0000ff; text-align: center;">Ozone (ppb): User home ozone levels from February to April 2020 at home in the Sierra Mountains, El Dorado County, California</p> <p style="font-family: georgia, garamond, serif; font-size: 18px;">Example (Cumulative Exposure):</p> <p>&nbsp;<img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/cd9469_e4108639411f4750a1d0339b829a1296~mv2.jpg" alt="" width="585" height="184" /></p> <p style="font-family: georgia, garamond, serif; font-size: 12px; color: #0000ff; text-align: center;">Ozone Cumulative Exposure: User home from February to April 2020 at home in the Sierra Mountains, El Dorado County, California.<span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">&nbsp;</span></p> <hr style="width: 70%;" /> <p style="font-family: Times, serif; text-align: left; font-size: 14px;">[1] OAR US EPA.
