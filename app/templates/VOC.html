<h2 style="font-family: georgia, garamond, serif; font-size: 26px; font-style: italic; text-align: center;">Volatile Organic Compounds</h2> <p style="font-family: georgia, garamond, serif; font-size: 16px;">A variety of household items, such as candles, cooking fumes, room fresheners, cosmetics, cleaning products, and paints, emit Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs). VOCs are organic chemicals that are usually in gaseous form at room temperature, and they are photo-chemically active. Short-term exposure to VOCs can cause optic or respiratory irritation, headaches, memory lapses, and dizziness. Long-term exposure can also incite nausea, fatigue, organ damage, and cancer [1]. In our experimental results, we see that 3d printer use causes high spikes in tVOCs.</p> <p style="font-family: georgia, garamond, serif; font-size: 16px;">0&ndash;220ppb of tVOC is healthy, 221-660ppb is average, 661-2000ppb is dangerous, and greater than 2000 is very unhealthy [2]. AMS measures not just long-term general exposure, but also hyper-local short-term exposure through its collection of data every ten minutes.</p> <hr style="width: 70%;" /> <p style="font-family: georgia, garamond, serif; font-size: 18px;">Example (Time Series &amp; Cumulative Exposure):</p> <p style="font-family: georgia, garamond, serif; font-size: 14px;">Time series figure below reflects unhealthy spikes in tVOC data on specific in the user&rsquo;s home caused these spikes. Further research confirmed that 3D printing is indeed a source of many VOCs [3]. Filament types varied from PLA, ABS, and TPU. This analysis established the need for extra ventilation when using a 3D printer.</p> <p><span style="text-align: left; color: #0000ff;"><span style="text-align: left; color: #0000ff;"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/cd9469_df9bfef402b642c49c40617dbdb65714~mv2.jpg" alt="" width="585" height="184" /></span></span></p> <p style="font-family: georgia, garamond, serif; font-size: 12px; color: #0000ff; text-align: center;">PtVOC (ppb): User home from February to April 2020 at home in the Sierra Mountains, El Dorado County, California. 0 to 200 ppb (below green horizontal line) marks the healthy range, and anything above 2200 ppm is extremely unhealthy (above red horizontal line).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p style="font-family: georgia, garamond, serif; font-size: 14px;">Cumulative pollution data of tVOCs in the time-series user location shows how much tVOC pollution the user has been exposed to each day. Acquisition of the 3D printer by the user shows how tVOC levels started to rise rapidly. Alerting the user of these changes can help with improving the personal atmosome.</p> <p style="font-family: georgia, garamond, serif; font-size: 18px;"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/cd9469_cc8f76306f6e411b940e0fd4f77432c2~mv2.jpg" alt="" width="585" height="184" /></p> <p style="font-family: georgia, garamond, serif; font-size: 12px; color: #0000ff; text-align: center;">tVOC Cumulative Exposure: User home from February to April 2020 at home in the Sierra Mountains, El Dorado County, California</p> <p style="font-family: georgia, garamond, serif; font-size: 18px;"><br />Example (Conditions):</p> <p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/cd9469_b6389e27bea7490392971e384ea16d53~mv2.jpg" alt="" width="585" height="184" /></p> <p style="font-family: georgia, garamond, serif; font-size: 12px; color: #0000ff; text-align: center;">tVOC (ppb): User atmosome in 4 locations: Cupertino, California; Hyderabad, India; commercial airplanes over the Pacific; and commercial airplanes over the Indian Ocean. 0 to 200 ppb (left of green vertical dash) marks the healthy range, and anything above 2200 ppm (red vertical dash) is extremely unhealthy. We see that although commercial aircraft use filtration systems and are relatively high above surface air pollution, there is still a measurable effect on the cabin air quality based on ground air pollution (comparing green and red).<span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">&nbsp;</span></p> <hr style="width: 70%;" /> <p style="font-family: Times, serif; text-align: left; font-size: 14px;">[1] National Institutes of Health.
