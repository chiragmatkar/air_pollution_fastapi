<h2 style="font-family: georgia, garamond, serif; font-size: 26px; font-style: italic; text-align: center;">Carbon Dioxide</h2> <p style="font-family: georgia, garamond, serif; font-size: 16px;">Carbon dioxide (CO2) classifies as a dominant air pollutant. Moderately high concentrations of CO2 in indoor air can lead to drowsiness, fatigue, and headaches, and increasing amounts can cause dizziness and nausea [1]. At extremely high concentrations, CO2 can even cause displacement asphyxia [2]. In our experimental data, we also see increases in CO2 during indoor exercise events. The simple process of improving ventilation can reduce high concentrations of CO2 in homes and workplaces and improve productivity and comfort.</p> <p style="font-family: georgia, garamond, serif; font-size: 16px;">Health effects of varying levels of CO2 are as follows: 351-450ppm is a healthy outdoor level, 451-700ppm is normal, 701-1000ppm is acceptable, 1001-2500ppm causes drowsiness and other symptoms of discomfort, 2501-5000ppm is detrimental to health, and anything higher than 5000ppm is extremely unhealthy [3].</p> <hr style="width: 70%;" /> <p style="font-family: georgia, garamond, serif; font-size: 18px;">Example (Conditions):</p> <p style="font-family: georgia, garamond, serif; font-size: 14px;">The results were different than expected because the readings in the US showed much higher indoor CO2 levels than the readings in a more polluted area in India. Further analysis revealed, however, that the closed windows and doors throughout the day in wintery US weather reduced circulation and increased CO2 concentration indoors. Results also led to the conclusion that the higher CO2 levels in the US setting were correlated to constant drowsiness reported in the home. This data highlights the importance of ventilation, even through the winter. The readings in the lengthy airplane journey confirmed that AMS&rsquo;s readings and the airline&rsquo;s advertised AQI were within range of each other.</p> <p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/cd9469_feb6c0dbf2474cd793cc9156fa2c6eb0~mv2.jpg" alt="" width="585" height="184" /></p> <p style="font-family: georgia, garamond, serif; font-size: 12px; color: #0000ff; text-align: center;">Carbon Dioxide (ppm): User atmosome in Cupertino, Hyderabad, a long airplane flight, and a shorter airplane flight. 0 (green vertical dash) to 1000 ppm (yellow vertical dash) is the healthy range, and anything higher than 5000 ppm is dangerous (red vertical dash). Comparison between short (red) and long (green) flights show the accumulation of cabin carbon dioxide which causes direct changes to blood bicarbonate levels. <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">&nbsp;</span></p> <hr style="width: 70%;" /> <p style="font-family: Times, serif; text-align: left; font-size: 14px;">[1] National Institutes of Health.
