# Air Pollution API with FastAPI and MongoDB

This is a small sample project demonstrating how to build an FastAPI app with MongoDB for air pollution information 

## TL;DR

If you really don't want to read the [blog post](https://developer.mongodb.com/quickstart/python-quickstart-fastapi/) and want to get up and running,
activate your Python virtualenv, and then run the following from your terminal (edit the `MONGODB_URL` first!):

```bash
# Install the requirements:
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure the location of your MongoDB database:
export MONGODB_URL="mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<url>/<db>?retryWrites=true&w=majority"

# Start the app:
./run.sh
```
